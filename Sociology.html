<div class="pargraf"><p class="p"><b><span class="span">Sociology </b></span>Global trends towards social studies are increasing, as a result of civilizational and scientific expansion, the expansion of human societies and the emergence of many developments that have greatly affected society, including the emergence of the Internet and social media, immigration and addiction issues, and other contemporary social issues that have affected the life and development of societies. There is also an urgent need for sociologists to study these issues and find effective solutions to societal problems. The term sociology emerged with the emergence of the need to explain societal phenomena and their laws in light of intellectual and philosophical expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The efforts of scientists began in studies and research, and social studies flourished by scientists in Europe and the United States of America during the twentieth century; So they did a lot of field research,Educational and collage institutions have begun to take an interest in teaching and graduating specialists.</p>
<p>
The first to call the term "sociology" was the French philosopher Auguste Conte who had a role in developing a specific definition of sociology and its evolution and defining its laws and paths. Also, a number of sociologists immortalized their names throughout history with their contributions in the field of specialization such as the Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldoun.</p>
