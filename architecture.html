<div class="pargraf"><p class="p"><b><span class="span">Architecture </b></span>Architectural engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines, and its appearance dates back to nearly 4000 years BC, as it is the basis of various civilizations, whether Pharaonic, Ottoman, Chinese and other ancient civilizations that built in their ages the greatest buildings and ancient architectural designs and began to evolve urbanization  The architectural character differs from time to time.
<br><br>
Therefore, architecture is the basis of civilizations and the main pillar of urban development. Architecture is concerned with designing buildings and housing complexes by following the standards and proportions required for residential units, whether villas, apartments, studios, hotels, tourist villages, and resorts.
<div class="divhr7"><h1>The importance of Architectural Engineering:</h1></div>
<p>The importance of studying architectural engineering is due to the specialization that also supports the civil engineer through relying on architectural designs and engineering studies to start the construction phase of the site and follow the work of technicians and supervise implementation.  It is also keen to take into account the environmental and geological phenomena of the region that need to be built and the surrounding facilities while carrying out the designs.

<div class="divhr4"><h1>The college content of the Architectural Engineering major:</h1></div>
<p>The duration of the study of architecture (architecture) in universities is 4 years for the undergraduate stage and the academic content in most Turkish universities includes a variety of study programs, knowing that the content may differ from one university to another, the student must verify the course description of the Course Description on the site  The university he wants to study at before enrolling.<br>
