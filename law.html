Rulers and judges in those ages wrestled with many challenges and various crimes, and set appropriate penalties for each crime. Thus, it is the basis of states and their systems, as the field of rights draws the main framework of the state's legislation of laws and regulations. The law also regulates the relationships of individuals with each other, such as the Labor and Insurance Law, which guarantees the rights of workers and guarantees the right of companies to return to their employees and hold them legally accountable in the event that any of them commits acts that contradict the company's policy.
