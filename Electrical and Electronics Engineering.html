<div class="pargraf"><p class="p">The <b><span class="span">  electrical and electronics engineering  </b></span>
major covers a number of different sciences, including electrical and energy sciences, electronics, automatic control systems, wireless communications, practical applications of electricity, in addition to electronic applications. The major is divided into two main departments, namely the Department of Electricity, and it teaches students electrical systems in power transmission and motor control, and the Department of Electronics, and the students study in electronic systems that include computer science and integrated circuits. Electronic engineering is a part of electrical engineering, as electrical engineering deals with the study and design of many diverse electrical and electronic systems.
<div class="divhr3"><h1>The importance of electrical and electronics engineering</h1></div>
<p>
Electrical equipment and devices is an essential pillar on which people depend in various fields. Therefore, electrical and electronics engineering plays an important and pivotal role in modern life and current and future technological developments. That are widely used today.<br><br><br>
Electrical and Electronic Engineering contributes to many different disciplines, from medicine to communications, and from computer and internet technologies to space research, and also contributes to designing and developing electrical systems and testing electrical equipment by applying physics, mathematics, electricity, electromagnetism and electronics to all systems and developing smart applications such as smart homes. Smart roads and smart cities.</p>
